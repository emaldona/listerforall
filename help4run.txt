Usage: runit.sh [-h] [-b] [-s] [-t]

This script runs CapabilitiesList test.

Capabilities run tool options:

    -h               display this help and exit
    -b               path to where jss was built (such as $HOME/buildjss/jss)
    -s               path to slf4j jar file, either system's or latest built


Since './runit.sh -t clean' is not working, use the Makefile directly to
remove classes and/or the listings directory.
