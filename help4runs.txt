Usage: runits.sh [-h] [-b] [-s] [-t]

This script runs CapabilitiesList test
againts the system-installed jss instead
of the one just built

Capabilities run tool options:

    -h               display this help and exit
    -b               path to where tests-jss were built (such as $HOME/buildjss/jss)
    -s               path to system's slf4j jar files
    -j               path to system's jss jar file


Since 'clean' is not working, use the Makefile directly to
remove classes and/or the listings directory.
