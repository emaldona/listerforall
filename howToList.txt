To determine the path to the system-installed jss files in various Linux distros
you can do the following:
Fedora:
   since F37: rpm -ql dogtag-jss 
   while on earlier releases it's rpm -ql jss
Debian:
   dpkg -L libjss-java
openSUSE Tumbleweed:
   rpm -ql mozilla-jss

Adding `| grep jar` to the above will narrow down the list to only jar files and
you'll see in some cases that some are symbolic links to other ones.

Similarly for slf4j.
